Structural response prediction using Deep Neural Networks (LSTM)
There are three main approaches for determining how structures respond under service conditions and extreme events: using sensor data from actual structures, conducting experi-
mental tests and laboratory testing, and performing numerical simulations. Among these approaches, the first method is considered the most realistic as it relies on measurements from real structures. Laboratory
testing can also provide realistic information as tests are conducted on physical structures or their components. However, limitations of the first and second methods include the scarcity of instrumented structures
and constraints related to time, budget, and laboratory space. On the other hand, numerical simulations are the most common and convenient approach due to the availability of standard software. Although the
accuracy of numerical simulations depends on the mathematical assumptions employed, they are relatively less realistic compared to the first two methods. Nevertheless, numerical models such as the Finite Element
Method (FEM) are commonly used to compute the linear and nonlinear response of structures under extreme events and service conditions. Nonlinear time history analyses, in particular, can be time-consuming due to the need for step-by-step time integration and nonlinear iterative solutions in each time step.
In this project, the goal is to utilize deep neural networks to obtain the structural response of buildings.
This approach is expected to have several benefits, including enabling the use of sensor data from instrumented structures to estimate response in potential future earthquakes and providing a computationally
efficient alternative to standard nonlinear time history analyses for obtaining a structural response.
